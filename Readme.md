# _JSON GENERATOR over JSON?_

- Since the JSON encoding that's generated by Apex through the serialization method in the System.JSON class 
  isn't identical to the standard JSON encoding in some cases, the System.JSONGenerator class is provided 
  to enable the generation of standard JSON-encoded content.
  
- The System.JSONGenerator class is provided to enable the generation of standard JSON-encoded content and 
  gives you more control on the structure of the JSON output.
  
- There are less chances of having an Structure problem in your hardcoded json response if it is build using 
  the Generator class.
  
- You can check if you response is properly closed or not using generator class's function "isClosed()".

- This class is very useful if you are creating a Mock class which uses the JSON response. So you either 
  write whole JSON( and cover it between single inverted commas ! ) or you use Static resources method. 
  Using the JSON generator in this case will make you code look good and there are less chances of any 
  exceptions occurrence.
